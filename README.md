# Quarentivities
Have you ever had nothing do in your house during a quarentine? Well uh now you do.

## Start

Running `npm run start-dev` will make great things happen!

If you want to run the server and/or `webpack` separately, you can also
`npm run start-server` and `npm run build-client`.

From there, just follow your bliss.
